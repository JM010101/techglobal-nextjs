# Excessive API Calls Fix

## Issue Identified
Your application was making excessive API calls to the same endpoints repeatedly:
- `/api/team` 
- `/api/blog?limit=6`
- `/api/projects`
- `/api/services`

This was causing:
- ❌ Poor performance
- ❌ Unnecessary server load
- ❌ Potential rate limiting issues
- ❌ Poor user experience

## Root Cause
The problem was in the `useEffect` dependency arrays in these components:
- `src/components/sections/Services.tsx`
- `src/components/sections/Blog.tsx` 
- `src/components/sections/Portfolio.tsx`
- `src/components/sections/Team.tsx`

Each component had sample data arrays in their `useEffect` dependency arrays:
```typescript
// ❌ PROBLEMATIC CODE
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, [sampleData]); // This caused infinite re-renders!
```

## Why This Happened
1. **Array Recreation**: The `sampleData` arrays were recreated on every render
2. **Reference Change**: React saw the array reference as "different" each time
3. **Infinite Loop**: This triggered `useEffect` to run again, causing another render
4. **API Spam**: Each render made new API calls

## Solution Applied
Removed the sample data arrays from dependency arrays:

```typescript
// ✅ FIXED CODE
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/endpoint');
      const data = await response.json();
      if (data.success) {
        setData(data.data);
      } else {
        setData(sampleData); // Fallback to sample data
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      setData(sampleData); // Fallback to sample data
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  fetchData();
}, []); // Empty dependency array - runs only once
```

## Files Fixed
1. ✅ `src/components/sections/Services.tsx`
2. ✅ `src/components/sections/Blog.tsx`
3. ✅ `src/components/sections/Portfolio.tsx`
4. ✅ `src/components/sections/Team.tsx`

## Benefits
- ✅ **Performance**: API calls now happen only once per component mount
- ✅ **Server Load**: Dramatically reduced server requests
- ✅ **User Experience**: Faster page loads and smoother interactions
- ✅ **Resource Usage**: Lower bandwidth and CPU usage
- ✅ **Reliability**: No more API rate limiting issues

## Testing
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ All components still work correctly
- ✅ Fallback to sample data still works when API fails

## Result
Your application will now make API calls only once when each component mounts, instead of continuously making requests. This should resolve the excessive API call issue you were experiencing.
