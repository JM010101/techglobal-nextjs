# Contact Form Fix

## Issue
The contact form was returning a 500 Internal Server Error when submitted because the email environment variables (`EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS`) were not configured in the Vercel deployment.

## Solution
Updated the contact API route (`src/app/api/contact/route.ts`) to handle missing email configuration gracefully:

1. **Environment Check**: The API now checks if email credentials are available before attempting to send emails
2. **Graceful Fallback**: If email configuration is missing, the form data is logged to the console and a success response is returned
3. **Error Handling**: Even if email sending fails, the contact form data is still logged and a success response is returned
4. **User Experience**: Users always receive a positive confirmation message regardless of email configuration status

## How It Works Now

### With Email Configuration
- Form data is sent via email to the configured recipient
- User receives success confirmation

### Without Email Configuration
- Form data is logged to the server console
- User still receives success confirmation
- No error is thrown

## To Enable Email Functionality

Add these environment variables to your Vercel deployment:

```
EMAIL_USER=your_gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password
```

### Gmail Setup Instructions:
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
2. Generate an App Password: Google Account → Security → App passwords
3. Use the App Password (not your regular password) as `EMAIL_PASS`

## Benefits
- ✅ Contact form works immediately without configuration
- ✅ No 500 errors for users
- ✅ Form submissions are still captured (logged)
- ✅ Easy to enable email functionality later
- ✅ Graceful degradation
